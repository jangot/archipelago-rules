### Loan Domain (WIP)


## Entities Relationship

**Relationship Explanation:**

- **Loan** connects to **ApplicationUser** twice: once as a **lender**, once as a **borrower**.
- **Loan** references a **Biller**.
- **Loan** references **PaymentAccount** (for both lender and borrower accounts).
- **Loan** has a collection of **LoanPayments**.
- **LoanInvitee** references **Loan**.
- **LoanPayment** references **Loan** and has a collection of **Transfers**.
- **Transfer** references **PaymentAccount** for its source/destination, and an (optional) **LoanPayment**.
- **PaymentAccount** belongs to **ApplicationUser** (the account owner).
- **Biller** references **ApplicationUser** as the creator (createdBy).

  ## LoanPayments and Transfers

  ### LoanPayments
**LoanPayment** - Entity that reflects a certain payment from Loan lifecycle. During `Funding`, `Disbursing` and `Repaying` states of the **Loan** Zirtue should execute funds transfers between **Lender**, **Borrower**, **Biller** and **internal accounts**. LoanPayments allows to keep track of such funds transfers which are started, failed or completed successfully. LoanPayments won't be created for scheduled in advance payments to keep data transparent.

Here is a current structure of LoanPayment:
```typescript
  /** UUID */
  id: string;

  /** The amount of payment */
  amount: number;


  /** Id of the Loan that keeps this payment */
  loanId: string; 

  /** Loan Entity */
  loan: Loan; 


  /** Reflects the Payment Index for Loan Repayments.
   * `null` while Loan is not in Repayment state.
   */
  paymentIndex: number | null;

    /** Shows for what Loan lifecycle Payment is assigned
   * `funding` - Lender transfers funds to Zirtue
   * `disbursement` - Zirtue transfers funds to Biller
   * `fee` - Lender pays Zirtue fee
   * `repayment` - Borrower repays Lender
   * `refund` - Performing refund for the payment
   */
  type: LoanPaymentType;

    /** Indicates order number for Loan Payment if multiple stages are involved.
   * Ex: In Loan 'Repayment' stage `0` is for `Borrower->Zirtue` payment and `1` for `Zirtue->Lender`.
   * For one-stage payments and by default `0` is used.
   */
  stage: number;

    /** Indicates current state of the Loan Payment.
   * `pending` - Payment is executed but not completed yet
   * `completed` - Payment was executed successfully
   * `failed` - Payment was not executed successfully due to some error
   */
  state: LoanPaymentState;

  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date | null;

    /** What date Loan Payment was executed last time. 
     * Should be the same with `originalExecutionDate` if it is first execution attempt, 
     * otherwise - should contain the date of latest re-attempt */
  executionDate: Date;

    /** Date for which Loan Payment was originally scheduled */
  originalExecutionDate: Date;

    /**
   * Collection of Transfers that are part of this Loan Payment.
   * Ideally should contain only one Transfer. 
   * But if Transfer failed and re-attempt happened - new Transfer will be also referenced to the same Loan Payment.
   */
  transfers: Transfer[] | null;
```

Let's take a look on example:
Imagine that we have a Direct Bill Pay Loan that in `Repaying` state, last payment just failed after re-attempt. Loan was configured to three repayments. Here is an array of LoanPayments that were created during the whole Loan lifecycle (some fields are removed to improve readability):
```typescript
// 1. Funding: Lender transfers funds to Zirtue
{ amount: 1000, loanId: 'loan-uuid', paymentIndex: null, type: 'funding', stage: 0, state: 'completed', transfers: [lender-zirtue-transfer] },
// 2. Funding: Lender pays fee to Zirtue
{ amount: 30, loanId: 'loan-uuid', paymentIndex: null, type: 'fee', stage: 0, state: 'completed', transfers: [lender-zirtue-fee-transfer] },
// 3. Disbursement: Zirtue transfers funds to Biller
{ amount: 1000, loanId: 'loan-uuid', paymentIndex: null, type: 'disbursement', stage: 0, state: 'completed', transfers: [zirtue-biller-transfer] },
// 4.1 Repayment #1: Borrower -> Zirtue
{ amount: 333.33, loanId: 'loan-uuid', paymentIndex: 0, type: 'repayment', stage: 0, state: 'completed', transfers: [borrower-zirtue-transfer1] },
//     Repayment #1: Zirtue -> Lender
{ amount: 333.33, loanId: 'loan-uuid', paymentIndex: 0, type: 'repayment', stage: 1, state: 'completed', transfers: [zirtue-lender-transfer1] },
// 4.2 Repayment #2: Borrower -> Zirtue
{ amount: 333.33, loanId: 'loan-uuid', paymentIndex: 1, type: 'repayment', stage: 0, state: 'completed', transfers: [borrower-zirtue-transfer2] },
//     Repayment #2: Zirtue -> Lender
{ amount: 333.33, loanId: 'loan-uuid', paymentIndex: 1, type: 'repayment', stage: 1, state: 'completed', transfers: [zirtue-lender-transfer2] },
// 4.3 Repayment #3: Borrower -> Zirtue
{ amount: 333.34, loanId: 'loan-uuid', paymentIndex: 2, type: 'repayment', stage: 0, state: 'completed', transfers: [borrower-zirtue-transfer3] },
//     Repayment #3: Zirtue -> Lender
{ amount: 333.34, loanId: 'loan-uuid', paymentIndex: 2, type: 'repayment', stage: 1, state: 'failed', transfers: [zirtue-lender-transfer3-1, zirtue-lender-transfer3-2] },
```

Note: In most positive case scenario (all transfers were succeeded during whole Loan lifecycle) the number of Transfers made is equal to number of LoanPayments stored.
