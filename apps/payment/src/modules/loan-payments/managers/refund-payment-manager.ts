 * - Process refund transfers for loan cancellations and overpayments
 * - Handle fee reversals and partial refund scenarios
 * - Support multiple refund recipients (borrowers, billers, etc.)
 * - Calculate appropriate refund amounts based on loan history
 * - Integrate with payment history for accurate refund calculations
